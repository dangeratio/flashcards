# flashcards
a cakephp based implementation of flashcards

I use XAMPP for a MySQL server and an Apache web server, nothing special just a basic flashcard interface using cakephp

Initial Features:
- Multiple flashcard sets
- Ability to "test" which shows the front and after a click shows the back of a random flashcard in the set
- Ability to add cards to a set
- Ability to edit the title or delete a set
